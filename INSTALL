The usual 
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

If you want to make use of Class::Array::Exception, Error::Filter (from me)
has to be installed, too. And if you want to use Class::Array::WithDBI,
DBI has to be installed of course. I don't know how to handle this in
a clean (optional) way, so currently these modules will be installed regardless
of whether the dependencies are satisfied and you have to install
the latter manually, sorry about that.
