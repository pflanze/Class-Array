The usual 
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

*except* for one thing: if you want to use Class::Array::Exception or 
Class::Array::ExceptionFilter, you have to install a patched version of
Filter::Simple. I've taken care I don't disturb the usual operation of the
patched version, so you should be able to just overwrite your existing
installation without other applications to break.

  I also recommend that you install a patched version of Text::Balanced,
since the upstream version as of 2 Apr 2002 does have a bug in it's heredoc
handling, which I didn't know how to fix correctly but did a fix that seems
to work well enough.

  Patch installation instructions:
  (Note that this assumes that the current versions on cpan 
  are still 0.77 or 1.89, or are still patcheable)

perl -MCPAN -eshell
get Text::Balanced
get Filter::Simple
exit (or is it quit? Ctrl-D)

cd CPANBASEDIR/build/Filter-Simple-0.77
patch -p0 < PATH_TO/Filter-Simple.cj.diff
perl Makefile.PL
make install

cd CPANBASEDIR/build/Text-Balanced-1.89
patch -p0 < PATH_TO/Text-Balanced.cj.diff
perl Makefile.PL
make install

(CPANBASEDIR is usually something like /root/.cpan)
